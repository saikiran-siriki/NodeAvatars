# NodeAvatars
Create your own avatar or emojiavatar. This is inspired from [avataars-generator](https://github.com/fangpenlin/avataaars-generator/) by [Fang-Pen Lin](https://github.com/fangpenlin)

## How to use

To run the server locally, simply run 
```
npm install && node index.js
```

I have deployed it here: [https://nodeavatar.herokuapp.com/](https://nodeavatar.herokuapp.com/)
